redditPicScraper
================
This is a personal project I'm working on in order to develop a nice GUI for users who are interested in scraping pics off of subreddits. Of course, anyone viewing this page should feel free to add on and develop for it.
  
Features to Implement:  
* Providing reddit credentials to the program to let it go through all your subreddits automatically
* Automatically assigning certain images to become background images
* Downloading images based on metrics such as user score and number of comments
* Traversing subreddits behind the "over18" page
* A much better looking GUI (what exists is very bare bones)
  
Tools used in this project:
* mechanize
* PyQt
